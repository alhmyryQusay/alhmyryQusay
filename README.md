## 🔐 About Me
I am a **Cybersecurity Analyst** with hands-on experience across **Security Operations (SOC)**, **Incident Response**, and **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)**.

I work on **monitoring, detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents** by analyzing logs, alerts, and endpoint activity.  
My experience includes **alert triage**, **threat validation**, **host-based investigations**, and **escalation of confirmed incidents**, with a strong focus on identifying malicious behavior and improving overall security posture.

I am passionate about continuous learning, blue team operations, and developing strong analytical and technical skills across SOC, incident response, and endpoint security environments.
